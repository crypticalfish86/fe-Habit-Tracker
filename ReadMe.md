## _**Habit Tracker app: iOS, React Native**_

<br>

### **Project Overview:**

---

<br>

Welcome to our React Native demo, showcasing our team's technical skills. Our team has expertise in using React Native to build mobile apps that are user-friendly and scalable on both iOS and Android platforms.

Our demo app is a demonstration of our proficiency in designing UI, managing data, and integrating APIs and third-party services to create mobile applications.

We set out to learn new technology at every valuable opportunity, in this instance we were using TypeScript for the first time and exploring its functionality. The backend API is built using Django/Django Rest Framework, you can find the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/VladStoyanovADP/Habit-Tracker).

Alongside this, there is a video demo/presentation which can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUrSxLPm9Zo&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=VladStoyanov).
